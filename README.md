# JS Omnibox
The fastest way to run quick snippets of Javascript in Chrome without opening the console.

## Installation

2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and toggle 
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you just cloned.


## Usage
In the omnibox, type `'js '` (including the space), then your command.

For example you could send an alert to the page by running: `js alert('Hello world')`
